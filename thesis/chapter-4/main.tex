There are many qualities of any software library one could consider important.
In this research we focused foremost on providing minimalistic wrapper and staying as faithful as possible to original specification of the API.
By this we mean that appropriate GL functions take analogous parameters as in original spec and have their names and semantics preserved.
Major benefit of this approach is that we could simply follow the OpenGL specification when creating type safe facades around procedures.

Starting from these minimalistic principles we focused on providing maximal level of type safety. The main goal was to enable rejection of as many ill-formed programs at compile time as possible.



There are many levels of safety guarantees we can expect from any software package.
In this analysis we devise 


Here we consider alternative ways of programming computer graphics with use of OpenGL as rendering backend.

We distinguish between a language of choice and any framework at use. 

/section{Native C / C++ bindings}

The simplest way one can program with OpenGL is using platform provided C bindings contained within an os provided dynamic link library (.dll for MS Windows, .so ) along with appropriate function pointer loader.
The requirement for the latter stems from common practice among OS vendors to officially guarantee distribution of very dated version of the specification (1.1 for Windows).
This poses a requirement for manual function pointer loading at runtime, an approach that has two main benefits
- abstracts away details of dynamic library loading for different platforms, 
- provides unified mechanism for using optional core standard extensions.

Additionally to function pointer loading one needs to initialize OpenGL context following platform defined protocol.

Most commonly there exists a library for each task, some examples for PC are GLEW for function loading and GLFW for window creation and context creation.
Once these actions are accomplished one can use OpenGL in C or C++ provided appropriate attention to C interoperability.

Writing C application provides no auto

/section{Rust with unsafe bindings}

Rust toolchain provides a utility for automatically generating Rust Foreign Function Interface bindings to C called \texttt{bindgen}.
In this case all the setup needed for a Native C / C++ bindings application still applies. There exist appropriate counterparts to GLEW and GLFW.
Once context is initialized and function pointers loaded one can call C functions but Rust will require one to use these functions inside unsafe context.
