\chapter*{Introduction}

Rust is an open-source, general purpose, multi paradigm, compiled, statically and strongly typed language maintained by Rust Foundation.

Although general purpose, language lends itself particularly well to systems programming, where software reliability, scalability and efficiency are paramount.
These qualities can be attributed to powerful and expressive type system and ownership based memory management which guarantees memory safety without a garbage collector.

In the following sections we describe

\section{Language history}

Language had it's initial inception in 2006 by Graydon Hoare, a software engineer at Mozzilla. Language's name was inspired by fungus called Rusts \cite{thompson2023rust}. 

Fungus' lifecycle and reproduction cycle which is distributed, parallel and not prone to single point of failure seemed like qualifier -- CITATION NEEDED

Over time more and more people joined Hoare on work on the project and in 2009, Mozilla decided to sponsor the project by founding the development. Rust 1.0 released on the 15th of May 2015.
