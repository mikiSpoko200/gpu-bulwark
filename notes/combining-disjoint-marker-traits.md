## Combining disjoint marker traits

We could really use algebraic marker traits: Product and Sum (Forall, Exists)

This may be possible to achieve when \`marker\`'s provides associated type to disjoin on.
In such case it would be really nice to have a mechanism for easily making trait ~ disjointable ~ easily.

This would require marker types for disjoint subsets.
